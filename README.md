# Interactive Quiz Homework

## Objective
Create an interactive quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on conditional statements and loops.

## Requirements

- **HTML**: Construct the quiz with questions, options (radio buttons for multiple-choice, checkboxes for true/false), and a submit button.

- **CSS**: Style your quiz for a better user experience. Include styles for the quiz container, questions, and feedback messages.

- **JavaScript**: Implement logic to:
  - Calculate the score based on correct answers.
  - Use loops to iterate through questions.
  - Dynamically display the score and feedback using `.textContent`.

## Deliverables
Submit the following files:
- `quiz.html`: The quiz structure.
- `style.css`: Styles for the quiz.
- `script.js`: Logic to run the quiz and display results.

## Bonus
Enhance your quiz with additional features like question randomization, a countdown timer, or detailed feedback for each question.

Good luck!
